# 1. Applicant Information

**Team Name:** Unicorn.eth

**Website:**<https://unicorn.eth.link>

**Entity ENS Name:** unicorn.eth (Multisig wallet)

**Primary Contact:** Griff Green (griff.eth / @GriffGreen)

## Proposal Overview:

Unicorn.eth is an established ENS Service Provider, committed to accelerating ENS adoption and utility. We have built and scaled powerful infrastructure, creating over 19,000 ETHDenver subdomains,while also fixing the SporkDAO onboarding experience. We want to double down on these efforts and bring the value ENS’s technology can provide directly to the ENS community through the creation of ENS Accounts.

ENS Accounts will become the fastest way new community members onboard into the ENS Ecosystem, and the easiest way for current community members to stay up-to-date with everything that is going on. Everyone will get a safe wallet, best in class UX, and have all of the ENS ecosystem at their fingertips.

#### ENS Accounts will come in 2 forms:

1. Subnames for account.eth ENS Accounts
2. Self-serve & configurable .eth domain ENS Accounts which can onboard to subnames too!

We will bring new utility to .eth domains, making them more than an identity, but also the easiest and safest way to navigate the web3 space. Our infrastructure will offer simple and secure ENS management, create easy onboarding to the entire ENS Ecosystem, and even generate additional revenue streams for the ENS DAO!

## The Value ENS Accounts can bring

* **Utility for .eth domains**: .eth domains can become a secure wallet interface and a branded onboarded portal for safely and easily onboarding friends and family to the parts of web3 you want them to experience.
* **Community Management**: The ENS Accounts can be used to onboard anyone to the ENS ecosystem. They get a free account.eth subdomain, clear activations on the home page, and a launch pad to explore the ENS ecosystem safely.
* **App Discovery**: ENS Accounts will be the schelling point for discovering the ENS ecosystem of dapps, like a beautified, web3 powered ENS linktree. Dapps like [EFP](https://efp.app/), [vision.io](http://vision.io), [ens.tools](https://ens.tools/?collections=&search=), [ENS Fairy](https://ensfairy.xyz/), [Namestone](https://namestone.com/) and more are often not seen by the wider community, We will change that.
* **Intuitive Web3 UX**: No networks, no confusing popups, and of course, no 0x addresses; Dapps autoconnect making for the best ENS experience possible.
* **Secure Storage**: Providing the safest environment for ENS users to engage with the ecosystem, preventing user errors, scams and more.
* **Revenue**: Our goal is to bring value AND tangible revenue to the DAO, we don’t see this as just a grant, we see it as a partnership agreement that can potentially garner a >3x ROI.

## Vision

* ENS Accounts will help grow the ENS ecosystem, making it accessible to anyone, from shadowy super coders that want a quick and easy way to explore everything that ENS has to offer, to non-technical politicians that want an easy way to raise crypto donations for their campaign.
* Existing .eth domain holders will benefit from increased utility by turning their domains into fully functional wallets, and onboarding portals.
* ENS DAO will see new revenue opportunities through transaction fees, premium memberships, and sign-up fees
* The entire Ethereum ecosystem will have a safe way to navigate the web3 world, powered by ENS.

# 2. Eligibility Confirmation

## Company Age & Reputation:

Unicorn.eth emerged as a hackathon winner at Devconnect in Istanbul in late 2023 to become an ENS Service Provider. We’ve already given out 19,000+ subdomains, onboarded users at ETHDenver, and made [ChainID 0 part of the CAIP-10 standard](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/namespaces/blob/main/eip155/caip10.md#special-case-of-eoa) to allow EOAs to be safely resolved on all standard EVM chains with just one registration.

## Team Experience:

We’ve been deep in web3 for years. I (Griff) have been working in Ethereum since 2015, founded countless projects and have been active in the ENS since even before its initial launch. Gardner brings deep brand understanding and marketing experience, Russell, Alex & Krati all bring unique and valuable wallet experience. Marko started his web3 journey at Consensys and now leads design at General Magic. We’ve already successfully launched for ETHDenver, creating 19,000+ ENS subdomains, and we have several other clients using our tech.

### ENS Token Endorsement Requirement:

We intend to self-nominate. Griff has over 50k in ENS delegated.

### OFAC Sanctions Compliance:

We, Unicorn.eth, confirm that neither our organization nor any of our employees, contractors, or executive leadership is located in, or a resident of, an OFAC-sanctioned country. We further confirm that none of our business resources are derived from or routed through any country or entity that is subject to sanctions imposed by the United States (OFAC) or equivalent regulatory bodies. We pledge to remain compliant with all applicable sanctions laws and will promptly notify the ENS DAO if our status changes.

## Multi Year Stream Eligibility:

* We are an existing season 1 service provider in good standing.
* [Season 1 Application](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/service-provider-stream-nomination-thread/18142/36)

# 4. Scope of Work & Budget

### Initially Expected Scope:

#### NOTE: We must validate many assumptions by interviewing potential users and various ENS Stakeholders before committing to the following scope, however, we do expect it to follow these goals and assume our final product will only vary slightly.

## Goals:

1. Onboard new and existing community members to the ENS Ecosystem
2. Create new utility for .eth domains
3. Bring value AND revenue back into the DAO.

[![ENS Forum 3](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/6/6599468e79a1d635c77b5493aaedbc5a599a6879_2_690x392.png)ENS Forum 31900×1080 288 KB](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/6/6599468e79a1d635c77b5493aaedbc5a599a6879.png "ENS Forum 3")

## A. Account.eth - ENS’s Ecosystem Portal

* Build ENS Accounts into a powerful ecosystem portal to seamless onboard and activate the ENS community.
* Create a practical yet hyper-secure solution for storing ENS assets
* Add native support for seamless .eth domain purchase and domain name upgrades.
* Bring ecosystem dapps & popular dapps to the portal.
* Conduct community feedback loops.
* Share revenue opportunities with ENS DAO, potential revenue streams could include:
  + Premium membership tiers to unlock paid features
  + Swap fees
  + Transaction fees
  + Promotional sponsorships
  + And more
* We would like to split all profits with ENS DAO 50/50 until we have returned $1M back to the DAO, and after that move to a 95/5 split where we retain the 95% of the profits in perpetuity. This gives us a strong incentive to make ENS Accounts one of the go to solutions in the space.
* We will pay the DAO quarterly, alongside a transparent accounting report.

[![ENS Forum 4 - new community members onboard](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/3/3cf5b3de59d467c8e14db8028f319187a29be47a_2_690x392.jpeg)ENS Forum 4 - new community members onboard1900×1080 167 KB](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/3/3cf5b3de59d467c8e14db8028f319187a29be47a.jpeg "ENS Forum 4 - new community members onboard")

## B. Self-serve .eth Domain Accounts

* Enable .eth domain owners to create their own ENS Account at their .eth domain.
  + They can start with an account.eth subdomain and upgrade to their own .eth
  + Or they can bring their own .eth domain and use our ENS Account creation wizard.
* They will be able to customize their ENS Account, choose the applications, networks, tokens, etc that they include into their UI.
* They will also be able to onboard their friends/family/followers with subdomains to their own customized ENS Account.
  + By default, all ENS Accounts (account.eth subdomains and self-serve .eth domains and their subdomains) will have the ENS ecosystem apps installed, however the managers of the .eth domains will be able to remove these dapps if they wish from the UI
* Managers of .eth domains will collect 70% of the revenue generated by the people they onboard, and can charge membership fees to their community. the other 30% will be collected by us and be part of our revenue split with ENS DAO.
* We hope this revenue opportunity for ENS sub-communities can make ENS Accounts spread virally.

## C. Growth, Growth & more GROWTH!

* We are incentivized to market the hell out of this product. This is a huge opportunity for us, so we will do the following:
  + Create a multi-channel marketing campaign targeting both crypto native and non-crypto native users
  + Establish strategic partnerships with important dapps inside and outside the ENS ecosystem
  + Create a massive ENS Accounts launch campaign
  + Coordinate with ENS Labs and ENS DAO on our campaigns so we all stay in the loop
  + Have a multitude of clear channels for feedback so we can solve issues quickly if they arrive.
  + If we achieve product market fit, we will attempt more aggressive user acquisition strategies.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Success would look like

* Public wallet security report published
* Account.eth portal launched in August or earlier

# 5. Past Achievements

* Launched for ETHDenver 2024, onboarding 19,000+ ENS subdomains.
* Developed ChainID 0 for CAIP-10 standard.
* Delivered frictionless user experiences for ETHDenver attendees.
* Maintained high user satisfaction through personalized onboarding.
* Working with several other clients big and small on similar products.
  + Such as: Opolis, V DAO, ETHPhoenix & House of Web3.
* Great marketing! [Check us out on X](https://x.com/MyUnicornAcct) in fact, I’ll give you a sneak peak of the next promotional video we are working on (this is not the final cut)

[![](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/c/c269927e8ab623d3844b62ac2a9e8cf3fc4850b7.jpeg "What is Unicorn.eth?")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnY30_X50gs)
## Try out the ETHDenver Version!

Go to [app.ethdenver.com](https://app.ethdenver.com) on your phone (or desktop).

If you went to ETHDenver, login with the same email you used

If you didn’t go to ETHDenver, create an account with your email & click: “No you are not a sporkDAO member” and “Yes you want a free ticket” to speed run the onboarding.

Notice we airdrop tokens, stake them for you, and give you a personalized ENS ETHDenver subdomain, like [your-name.ethdenver.com](http://your-name.ethdenver.com).

Now you go to that domain, and this is your personalized portal to SporkDAO. We can make something similar for any community, including ENS!

But the real magic is the ecosystem UX! Not only do we put all the dapps a community needs directly into their account, we were able to cut out almost all of the weird popups that too often make web3 feel complex and scary.

**Try it out! Go to the “SPORK Staking DApp” and watch it pop up in a new tab, autoconnect, and then try unstaking your SPORK.**

Then tell me this isn’t the most magical UX you’ve seen for web3.

# 7. Conflict of Interest Statement

I (Griff Green) serve as a delegate for ENS, Arbitrum, OP, and Gitcoin. I also founded several projects in the space, many of whom requested funding from ENS previously and may request again, however, I believe that is irrelevant to being an SP. I do have an advisory role GovPal, and work closely with eth.limo and Namespace, who are all applying as service providers. We will ensure no conflicts interfere with our proposal and maintain transparency throughout the engagement.

# Conclusion

Unicorn.eth is well-positioned to drive ENS adoption by building out ENS Accounts. By giving this value away for free to the community, we have the opportunity to introduce the ENS ecosystem to a much wider audience. a robust account.eth ecosystem portal. With our experience, commitment to innovation, and deep Web3 expertise, we are excited to collaborate with ENS DAO to build a safer, more accessible Web3 future.

We appreciate your consideration and look forward to further contributing to the ENS ecosystem.
