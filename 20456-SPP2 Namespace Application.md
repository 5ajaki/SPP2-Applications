## 2. Dedicated BD Arm

[![](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/8/87f7137deba48fd1312e3352ec878c000f496e49_2_690x384.png)987×551 349 KB](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/8/87f7137deba48fd1312e3352ec878c000f496e49.png)

To quote jefflau.eth from [frENSday](https://frensday.ens.domains/): “*The Success of ENS is integrations*”, and we couldn’t agree more!

Similar to the relationship **Etherealize has with Ethereum**, we plan to create a BD department within Namespace, with the potential to evolve into the **standalone BD Arm of ENS** and the broader Namechain ecosystem in the future.

**State of the Subname market**

* 2M ENS names, but ~70% of all ENS name registrations happen through the ENS app (just one front-end).
* 15M Offchain subnames, but ~99% of all Offchain subnames are self-hosted infra (time/resource-intensive) and attributed to cb.id and uni.eth subnames (just two wallets).
* 1M L2 subnames, but 99% of almost all L2 subnames came from base.eth and linea.eth (just two L2 chains).

**Opportunity**

The data shows a massive untapped market for offchain and L2 subname registration. The demand is evident, but the reliance on self-hosted infrastructure and a small subset of wallets and chains indicates that the process is neither scalable, easily replicable, and therefore feasible for the average dev team or company, nor is it high on the priority list. The opportunity lies in creating out-of-the-box solutions to enable in-app offchain and L2 subname registrations, backed by a dedicated BD team focused on go-to-market execution, distribution, and industry outreach!

Selling ENS is unlike traditional sales – it requires deep technical understanding, the ability to communicate its unique value proposition effectively (differs from industry to industry), and the expertise to navigate the Web3 ecosystems. With Cap’s experience in building and scaling BD and Sales teams (having previously founded and run a sales company), leveraging our network after 7 years in crypto, and hands-on involvement with ENS for 3 years, our team is uniquely positioned to drive this initiative.

Building on [extensive experience](https://mirror.xyz/thecap.eth/2ijEyV8Gv2ioB5c3hT6gpWIMK45d2noLGP3KPEryQ-E) from 2024 in working with many clients, Namespace is launching a dedicated in-house BD team to drive ENS adoption through strategic partnerships, developer integrations, and ENS ecosystem expansion. This team will focus on collaborating with industry leaders and working to embed ENS into their core infrastructure, products, or apps.

**Objective**:

* Drive ENS subname adoption by securing high-value partnerships, expanding developer integrations, and ensuring ENS remains the most dominant naming service on the market by making sure its registration and resolution are supported everywhere.

**Deliverables**:

* Form a specialized BD team focused on outreach, partnerships, and integrations
* Drive developer adoption through integrations with dev tooling products and marketplaces
* Foster and grow relationships with companies, developers, and dev communities
* Identify new growth opportunities, go-to-market, and distribution strategies
* Discover new use cases of ENS in different industries

**Measurable Results**:

* Hire – 1 BDs and 1 DevRel person, led by Cap
* Develop a CRM pipeline
* Secure high-profile partnerships
* Increase developer integration and support for ENS
* Initiate and maintain conversations about ENS integration
* Lead sourcing and generation
* Increase Subnames minted
* Increase the number of companies offering Subname-as-a-Service

**KPIs**:

* Conservatively:
  + Identify and reach out to >100 potential clients through a strategic, relationship-driven approach – leveraging our network rather than relying on cold outreach (no aggressive and spammy DMs/Emails).
  + Aim for 20 high-value partnerships with key industry players.
  + Deploy 10 more white-label subname minting websites for clients.
  + Add Subname registrations with 3 wallets
  + Add subname registrations for 3 AI launchpads
  + Enable Subname-as-a-Service for 2 new rollups.
  + Enable ENS services on 2 dev tooling marketplaces
  + Add Subname registration with 2 games
  + Add Subname registrations for 2 payment-related apps.
  + Launch subname-as-a-service with 1 RaaS provider
  + Launch subname-as-a-service with 1 WaaS provider
  + Deploy 100+ ENS widgets across different websites
  + Reach 10,000 SDK installs, measured on NPM

**Targeted industries**:

We’ve been actively engaged with leaders from industries below in 2024, collaborated with some of them, and have a deep understanding of what they want, need, and find exciting about ENS.

* Wallets and wallet-as-a-service providers
* Payments (apps, on/off ramping, payroll services, etc.)
* AI agents and launchpads
* Rollup-as-a-Service providers
* Individual L2s running a chain-wide naming service
* Blockchain infra, tools, and service providers
* Brands and community subnames through Subpages
* Games (in-game usernames)
* Identity-related tooling and apps

## 3. Side Quests

At Namespace, we believe in a builder culture – a culture where innovation and experimentation are encouraged and rewarded. While our core services and products are the foundation of our mission, we allocate 10-20% of our efforts to Side Quests.

**Side Quests** are experimental, low-risk initiatives that complement a Namespace’s core objectives by exploring new opportunities, trends, or growth strategies. These projects are designed to test ideas quickly, drive engagement, and uncover insights or value that may not be immediately apparent through the main product focus.

Whether it’s launching a small app, experimenting with a growth hack, or engaging with emerging technologies and trends, side quests provide a way to stay agile, innovative, and connected with new market opportunities without diverting resources from long-term goals.

## Existing side quests

Last year, we successfully launched 3 impactful smaller projects and plan to keep working on them.

**Overview**:

1. **Subname Frames**: allows subname registrations through Farcaster frames from any name; our frames generated more than **7,000 subnames**.
2. **ENS Widget**: allows anyone to sell subnames from their own website – currently, there are more than **115 websites with the ENS widget** installed and issuing subnames.
3. **Subpages**: white-label solutions allowing devs to quickly deploy a customizable website with subname minting already embedded – currently, 5 active Subpages ([OP Punks](https://oppunk.namespace.ninja/), [SheFi](https://shefi.namespace.ninja/), [PizzaDAO](https://pizzadao.namespace.ninja/), [StaysOn.eth](https://stayson.namespace.ninja/), Nektar)

**Deliverables**:

* **Subname Frames**: build a new frame that lets all Farcaster users name their newly launched native Farcaster wallets.
* **ENS Widget**: make it more configurable (new layout and design options – the most requested feature by far).
* **Subpages**: continue to improve, add more features, and continue to deploy them for communities.

**Measurable Outcomes**:

* **Frames**: Deploy 10 more frames for companies or communities.
* **ENS Widget**: Integrate the widget with 50 more websites.
* **Subpages**: Deploy 10 more Subpages for high-profile brands and communities.

## Planned

#### ENS AI CEO

**Objective**:

* A fun, engaging, and chatty AI agent on Warpcast and X, designed to educate, entertain, and assist users with ENS-related questions. It boosts ENS visibility, fosters interactions and cultural relevance, and delivers helpful (and occasionally spicy) responses with a playful yet insightful touch.

**Deliverables**:

* Conceptualize and design the AI agent profile
* Deploy the agent on X and Warpcast
* Increasing ENS brand awareness
* Fine-tune, train, improve

**Measurable Outcomes + KPIs**:

* 1,000 Twitter and Warpcast followers
* 500 comments and replies
* 500 posts on social media
* 1M total impressions
* Increased ENS brand awareness

### A la carte

* **Host ENS event**: ENS event for ETHBelgrade (see [last year’s event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVbBKlmAEFU&t=2s))
* **ENS advocacy at conferences**: ETHPrague, ethCC, Devcon, and more.
* **Livestreams and Interviews** – after a very successful [Livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMZ9CPZlEM) recently, I decided to try and do them more regularly. This requires no extra effort on my part—I already live and breathe ENS.
* Focus would be on: ENS, partnerships and integrations, DAOs, Ecosystem, Digital Identity.

## Budget

* Asking for a $400k budget to cover development costs, salaries for 9 people, operational expenses, and infrastructure costs.

## 4.3 Second Year Stream Scope of Work

For a second-year stream, we plan on continuing to run our core Subname service offerings, which include Namespace App, Namespace Dev Portal, and SDK. We’ll keep improving and iterating on these products, making them better in every way possible based on feedback and the needs of the ever-evolving market.

However, we believe that the crypto landscape changes so fast that a 2-year commitment to certain features or strategies is almost impossible. As the space evolves, we need to stay agile and adjust our development strategy accordingly. That means our focus may shift based on external circumstances.

That said, we’ll certainly continue our work with Subnames, ensuring their growth and adoption. Additionally, we’ll keep exploring ways to integrate AI agents into the ecosystem, as this remains a key area of interest. And we will certainly play the key role in bringing more partnerships and integrations, driving ENS adoption through different means, and solidifying ENS as everyone’s go-to naming service in Web3. These are foundational pillars that will remain central to our strategy.

Overall, we’re here to keep building and innovating for ENS, always prioritizing the clients and market needs, embracing new challenges, and staying committed to growing ENS adoption to the best of our abilities.

We decided to remove the Extended scope budget from our application.

We also put together [this thread](https://x.com/namespace_eth/status/1914655173944992082) to highlight our key achievements and contributions in 2024 – not as detailed as the application above, but a lot easier for delegates to go through and get the full picture.
