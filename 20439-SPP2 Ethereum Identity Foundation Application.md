**Company Overview**  

We’re committed to our work of building up **ENS as the center of the onchain Ethereum identity stack**, with years of successful track record to that end.

We’re the creators of [**Ethereum Identity Kit**](https://ethidentitykit.com/), **a component library and API that helps developers easily integrate ENS** and other complementary elements of the Ethereum identity stack as an identity layer into their crypto app. We have well designed ENS profile cards you can easily drop into your app, which among other things include header images. And yes, **we finally successfully coordinated the adoption of the “header” record** in the ENS ecosystem, which you’ll now find on EFP, Vision, Justaname, Rainbow Wallet, and more.

EIK also includes individual ENS profile elements, EFP follow buttons, checkout modals, and more. And **many apps around the ecosystem are now using EIK to bring ENS into their app.**

[![Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 1.53.55 PM](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/3/3f303f64b39f712c41d6665a433a64abb1b3ef47_2_690x395.jpeg)Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 1.53.55 PM1920×1101 137 KB](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/3/3f303f64b39f712c41d6665a433a64abb1b3ef47.jpeg "Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 1.53.55 PM")

And we’re the creators of [**Ethereum Follow Protocol**](https://efp.app/), **an onchain social graph protocol for Ethereum accounts that completes your ENS profile** with your onchain connections. **If ENS is the username and profile system, it needs a complementary social graph system, so we built it**. EFP is the only crypto social graph protocol that doesn’t have its own competing native naming and profile system and instead relies on ENS.

We have **tens of thousands of unique users** including prominent crypto users **like vitalik.eth** (who [highlighted our work](https://x.com/sat_eth/status/1902458655662076405) in his ENS Frensday talk), Jesse Pollak at Coinbase who was a day 1 user, sassal.eth, griff.eth, lefteris.eth, many members of ENS Labs, and more.

And we’ve **shipped dozens of integrations** of our projects including **big name apps like POAP, Snapshot, Superfluid, Rotki, Agora, Tally, Aragon, and more**.

[![Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 1.50.39 PM](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/b/b8f5aadf35f8204a7f8d19c726bbf6ac0fd887c6_2_690x388.jpeg)Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 1.50.39 PM1920×1080 164 KB](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/b/b8f5aadf35f8204a7f8d19c726bbf6ac0fd887c6.jpeg "Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 1.50.39 PM")

We’ve also been **successful in promoting ENS**, with our tweets receiving the **most engagement of any tweets about ENS**, including more than the ENS brand account, e.g., [Google integration](https://x.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1770957528983052375), [Namechain announcement](https://x.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1855813557323178067), [Congressman using ENS](https://x.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1886546900825883077), etc.

And we’ve presented our work at ETHcc, Frensday, and on podcasts.

[![Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 1.55.59 PM](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/1/15298aafe2dc13e46dd0c5ad8e9ed8f56173235b_2_690x379.jpeg)Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 1.55.59 PM1920×1057 121 KB](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/1/15298aafe2dc13e46dd0c5ad8e9ed8f56173235b.jpeg "Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 1.55.59 PM")

Previously, our team had years of experience successfully building up ENS: e.g., our Executive Director brantly.eth previously led the ENS core team during a phase of high growth and was the first to articulate the vision of your ENS name as your portable crypto username and profile, hence our dedication to this today; see the Team Experience section below for more on the whole team.

**Looking to the future, we have a lot of work to do** to expand and improve our existing projects, Ethereum Identity Kit and EFP, **adding new components, new features, making existing ones more performant, getting more integrations**, etc. We’ve begun work on **a new project ENS Worker**, a suite of high performance systems for fast bulk name, avatar image, header image, and profile lookups for apps that make heavy use of ENS, with a Railway template so others can easily spin up their own instance; see our Scope descriptions below for full details.

We’re grateful for the support we’ve received this last year from the ENS DAO, and, with your support, we look forward to continuing our work long into the future.

**Requested Amount:**

* *Basic scope*: $500k
* *Extended scope*: $700k
* *2 Year Stream?*: Yes, we are applying for the 2 year stream option, in addition to the 1 year stream option

**Size of team and commitment**  

*Tell us how many people will be working directly on this project and what is your overall commitment. ie., Is it something you and one other person will be doing part time after work? Is it something you have 10 devs working day and night committed to?*

You can see all our team member’s ENS profiles at a glance on our [Team page](https://ethid.org/#team).

We have 4 full time team members. I’ve included experience beyond our work from season 1 of the Service Provider program:

* **brantly.eth** (Executive Director) previously led the ENS core team (2019 - 2022, during a large growth phase and the launch of the ENS token and DAO), led the creation of Sign in with Ethereum ([EIP 4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361)), is an active delegate in the ENS DAO, and a member of the ENS DAO Security Council.
* **encrypteddegen.eth** (Frontend Dev, UI Designer) previously worked for the ENS secondary marketplace Kodex.
* **0xthrpw.eth** (Solidity, Infra Dev) previously worked for SuperFarm.
* **caveman.eth** (Dev Rel; previously sat.eth) has been a long time contributing member of the ENS community, in addition to his successful work in the Roblox community

We are committed 100% exclusively to our work in this application.

We also retain **bendi.eth** (CEO of ScopeLift) and **pell.eth** (DevOps at Coinbase) as technical advisors.

## 3. Open Source Commitment

All of our work is under an MIT license.

## 4. Scope of Work & Budget

### 4.1 Basic Scope of Work

**Requested amount**: $500k/year (same as last season)

**Description**  

*Describe the work you plan to accomplish at the minimum level of functionality or coverage.*

*Ethereum Identity Kit* ([ethidentitykit.com](https://ethidentitykit.com/))  

Ethereum Identity Kit, launched in late 2024, is a component library that makes it easy to integrate ENS and EFP into your crypto app, and is central to our work and strategy. In our design and docs, we are particularly targeting new developers to the crypto industry. Our continued development of it will focus on two areas: (1) expanding the number of components, and (2) refining existing components to be more performant and customizable.

New components may include: horizontal ENS profile card, condensed ENS profile card with more information on hover, ENS subname claiming tool, ENS record setting tool, EFP notifications widget, EFP followers and following list modal, EFP suggested accounts, SIWE buttons, and other components based on user requests.

*ENS Worker*  

We will develop our own ENS Worker, a suite of tools to quickly and efficiently fetch and serve in bulk ENS primary names, profile records, and images for avatars and headers at the level needed by a large consumer app making heavy use of ENS. We’ve seen the need for this from our own experience. We’ll make a Railway template for it, so anyone can easily run their own instance. This will also serve Ethereum Identity Kit components, the EFP manager app, and be accessible via our public API.

*Integrations of ENS and EFP* ([efp.app/integrations](https://efp.app/integrations))  

Both ENS and EFP are designed to be used mostly outside of their respective manager apps and instead in other crypto apps; meaning, integrations are required for their success.

We focus on both quantity and quality. In terms of quantity, we need ENS and EFP to be in as many crypto apps as possible, with the goal of complete ubiquity. In terms of quality, apps with more users are more valuable, and the more an app makes use of ENS and EFP the better.

We promote the integration of both ENS and EFP, both of which are at the center of Ethereum Identity Kit. Though ENS is older and more widely integrated than EFP, there are new apps every day, many older apps still don’t make use of ENS, and, of those that do, many have a broken or only partial ENS integration. We will continue to add new ENS integrations and improve existing ones, alongside new integrations of EFP (e.g. we recently fixed Superfluid’s ENS integration).

*Promotion*  

We will continue to promote ENS, EIK, and EFP on X/Twitter, at conferences, and on podcasts. (See the Past Achievements section for our success in this area in the last year.)

*API*  

We maintain and run a public API that serves a wide range of data from ENS and EFP, and our Railway Template makes it easy for someone to run their own instance of our system. In addition to making our existing endpoints more performant, we will continue to expand the data available in our endpoints as needed by Ethereum Identity Kit and by request from developers.

*EFP manager app* ([efp.app](https://efp.app/))  

We will continue to make performance improvements and add new features to the EFP app, which is structured around full ENS profiles. New features may include: ENS record setting tool, better import tools for Farcaster, Lens, and Twitter, Common Followers modal, improved Recommendations, a new About page, and more.

*EFP Indexer* ([Github](https://github.com/ethereumfollowprotocol/indexer))  

We will release an updated version of the EFP Indexer that requires only one indexer instance per chain (rather than one per List Records contract). Like our current version, this will be included in the EFP Railway Template to make it easy for others to run their own instance.

*EFP smart contracts* ([Github](https://github.com/ethereumfollowprotocol/contracts))  

We will deploy an upgraded and improved EFP List Records contract that prevents a certain kind of front running attack vector that becomes possible if/when Base switches to having a public mempool.

**KPIs / Success Metrics**  

*Per the discussion & temp checks, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) must be quarterly. Please List your quarterly KPIs for this scope. If KPI’s are expected to change over time, please indicate. Example: “Maintain 99% uptime for X service,” “Onboard 10 new ENS integrations per quarter,” etc.*

Per quarter: a minimum of 3 new EFP integrations with ENS improvements as needed, at least 1 new feature shipped in EIK, at least 1 new feature shipped in EFP app

**Budget**  

*Provide the requested annual budget for this basic scope. Budgets must be integer multiples of $100K/year (minimum $300K/year).*

$500k/year

Breakdown:  

$450k/year: team pay, contractors

$50k/year: admin, legal, infra expenses, etc

### 4.2 Extended Scope of Work

## 5. Past Achievements & Additional Information

*Use this section to illustrate your track record.*

**Summary**  

We’re committed exclusively to our work of building up **ENS as the center of the onchain Ethereum identity stack**, with years of successful track record to that end.

We’re the creators of [**Ethereum Identity Kit**](https://ethidentitykit.com/), **a component library and API that helps developers easily integrate ENS** and other complementary elements of the Ethereum identity stack as an identity layer into their crypto app. We have well designed ENS profile cards you can easily drop into your app, which among other things include header images. And yes, **we finally successfully coordinated the adoption of the “header” record** in the ENS ecosystem, which you’ll now find on EFP, Vision, Justaname, Rainbow Wallet, and more.

EIK also includes individual ENS profile elements, EFP follow buttons, checkout modals, and more. And **many apps around the ecosystem are now using EIK to bring ENS into their app.**

And we’re the creators of [**Ethereum Follow Protocol**](https://efp.app/), **an onchain social graph protocol for Ethereum accounts that completes your ENS profile** with your onchain connections. **If ENS is the username and profile system, it needs a complementary social graph system, so we built it**. EFP is the only crypto social graph protocol that doesn’t have its own competing native naming and profile system and instead relies on ENS.

We have **tens of thousands of unique users** including prominent crypto users **like vitalik.eth** (who [highlighted our work](https://x.com/sat_eth/status/1902458655662076405) in his ENS Frensday talk), Jesse Pollak at Coinbase who was a day 1 user, sassal.eth, griff.eth, lefteris.eth, and many more; and **shipped dozens of integrations** of our projects including **big name apps like POAP, Snapshot, Superfluid, Rotki, Agora, Tally, Aragon, and more** (and regularly fix their ENS integration).

* “Header”: We successfully organized the adoption of a new text record to further enrich ENS profiles, the “header” text record, which allows users to specify a header image, which you’ll now find on EFP, Vision, Justaname, Rainbow Wallet, and more.
* “Status”: We have implemented a new text record, “status”, which allows users to add a short update on what they’re doing to their ENS profile

**Successful Promotion of ENS**  

We have been successful in promoting ENS, with our tweets receiving the most engagement of any tweets about ENS, including regularly receiving more engagement than tweets from the ENS brand account. Some examples:

* We onboarded a U.S. Congressman to ENS and EFP, and successfully got him to put his .eth name in his Twitter bio ([tweet](https://x.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1886546900825883077), [tweet](https://x.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1886555001683620199), [tweet](https://x.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1885375525096460660), [tweet](https://x.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1885394471505760688))

## 7. Conflict Of Interest Statement

*List any potential conflicts of interest or participation in any project that is currently receiving from the DAO or is a candidate for it. This list includes (but is not limited to) having any of your team members be a Steward candidate, also being a member of another team who is a candidate for the same stream, having a compensated position at ENS Labs, Karpatkey or any other project who is currently receiving funds from the DAO. Explain how you intend to resolve the conflict if you (and the other party) are selected and how you will have a separation of concerns.*

EFP previously received a $50k grant from the ENS DAO Public Goods working group (late 2023), and a $500k/year stream from v1 of the Service Provider program. Brantly.eth receives a small payment in $ENS tokens for being a member of the ENS DAO Security Council.

Last years proposal from EFP made significant impact on the social elements of ENS.

Ethereum identity kit, ENS worker and EFP are all are high leverage outcomes for ENS worth supporting from our perspective.
