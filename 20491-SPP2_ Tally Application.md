**Size of team and commitment**  

Tally is a team of 16 full time team members, mostly product and engineering. Our backgrounds are diverse with a strong engineering culture led by our CTO, Rafael Solari. Our more public facing members: Dennison, Frisson and Coolhorsegirl primarily work on customer success and ecosystem outreach. We work closely with our partners and are frequently active contributors in the DAOs we participate in.

**Commitment:**  

The ENS community is an important part of Tally’s focus and user base. Tally is the most popular voting platform for ENS. On average ~70% of ENS voters vote on Tally. Tally also believes deeply in the value of the ENS primitive and is excited about the expansion of the protocol to Namechain. Our most recent work to extend the universality of ENS is our integration with the [Ethereum Follow Protocol](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1902768470091030735), an ethereum social graph built on ENS. [![](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/8/8169985349f6e6aa579ab2491edd180c88be5bcf_2_624x213.png)1072×366 24 KB](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/8/8169985349f6e6aa579ab2491edd180c88be5bcf.png)

We see ENS as a critical component for the universal interoperability of governance tooling.

## 3. Open Source Commitment

We commit that any work funded by SPP2 will follow the MIT license. If necessary, we will update relevant existing licenses to MIT.

## 4. Scope of Work & Budget

**Explanation Overview**  

Tally’s scope of work proposal is broken down into improving the accessibility and security of ENS Governance and the proliferation of the ENS as a core internet primitive for on-chain organizations.

To address these two themes we have defined a set of goals that instructs our proposal and roadmap.

Key Goals:

* **Goal 1:** Make the governance process more accessible and transparent
* **Goal 2:** Proliferate the ENS primitive and tools across the on-chain ecosystem

### 4.1 Basic Scope of Work: Accessibility, Security, and ENS distribution

**Requested amount**  

$300,000 USD

**Description**  

Our scope of work focuses on improving the accessibility, safety, and reach of ENS governance. This includes deeper integration with the ENS proposal process, enhanced support for Safes, automatic proposal execution, and the addition of an RSS feed for better governance transparency. We’re also working to expand the utility and adoption of ENS by integrating features into Tally—our governance app used by millions. These features include support for ENS record-based proposal actions, improved ENS resolution, and future compatibility with Namechain once live.

**Goal 1: Make the governance process more accessible and transparent**  

On average, 70% of the ENS DAO voter community uses the Tally platform to participate in ENS governance. This presents a fantastic opportunity to surface and organize information that enhances voter experience, lowers barriers to participation, and improves participation. To support our goal of making the process more accessible and transparent Tally will:

* Build a deeper integration with the ENS governance proposal process
  + Integrate the full ENS proposal lifecycle into the core app by surfacing Snapshot proposals, Discourse threads and Github PRs into the application. This makes it easier for voters to understand the lifecycle of proposals.

  + Automatically manage the lifecycle of onchain proposals via a proposal queue and execution bot. Currently Delegates and DAO members manually queue proposals for execution. This takes individual effort and gas and can potentially delay proposal execution. Automatic lifecycle management simplifies the proposal process and reduces the burden on Delegates to manually move proposals forward through the process.

* Enhance support for delegates operating with Safes by enabling Sign in with Safe as well as enhanced support for non-standard multisig setups such as nested multisigs.
* Maintain an independent RSS feed mechanism that exposes a running feed of critical DAO smart contract operations. This feed simplifies the process for third party builders and AI tools to monitor and integrate with the ENS governance operations.

**Goal 2: Proliferate the ENS primitive and tools across the on-chain ecosystem**  

As the largest governance platform in the Ethereum ecosystem, Tally has network effects that allows us to distribute primitives to many other organizations. In the past year on average 80 DAOs per quarter have deployed on Tally. Over $1 billion has been transferred using Tally proposals. This makes Tally an excellent partner to help the distribution of ENS. To support our goal of proliferating the ENS primitive and tools across the on-chain ecosystem, Tally will:

* Create no-code Tally proposal actions that allow organizations to easily update ENS text records through governance proposals. This eliminates the friction of using ENS with DAO owned smart contracts.

* Enhance ENS resolution on Tally by indexing offchain ENS names. Today, Tally indexes names from the core-onchain registry. This improvement would index any ENS name regardless of where it is and show it on that user’s Tally profile (eg: name.cb.id). This enhances the distribution and utility of the ENS protocol.
* Provide ENS Namechain support. Tally is a multi-network platform that supports 30+ layers 2s and blockchains. Tally will offer priority support for Namechain on the Tally platform, allowing users to build and deploy organizations on the Tally platform that are distributed on the Namechain network.

**The following are products we are excited to explore but still need to do more work to validate their feasibility and demand. As such, they are not explicitly included in the SoW.**

* Automatic ENS names: Over 250,000 users have joined DAO’s directly through the Tally governance product. Tally is exploring allowing for teams launching on Tally to directly distribute ENS names directly in their launch flow.

* Deployment build verification: In light of the SAFE hack, Tally has been thinking deeply about how to increase security of the build pipeline of its front end tools. To this end, we are considering a trust verification system to help allow builders to verify the authenticity of the Tally application powered by ENS. This tool could drive significant improvement in safety to ENS and the wider Ethereum ecosystem.
