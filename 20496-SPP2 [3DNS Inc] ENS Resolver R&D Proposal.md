## 1. Applicant Information

* Team Name: 3DNS
* Website: [3dns.box](http://3dns.box)

* Primary Contact(s): Paul Gauvreau - [X - Twitter](https://x.com/0xpaulio)

## 2. Company Overview

3DNS is an ICANN Accredited Registrar that pioneered the tokenization of traditional domain names. We’ve expanded ENS capabilities to create domain names that work both onchain as ENS names and offchain in your browser.

We made history by tokenizing the first ICANN-issued gTLD ([.BOX](http://my.box)), helping ENS gain recognition and adoption from major companies worldwide. Our team has scaled ENS to meet the performance standards of traditional web applications, blurring the lines between onchain and offchain experiences.

With our extensive background in building production-grade applications and breakthrough R&D initiatives, we’re now proposing to extend the ENS protocol through new resolver standards. These standards will allow ENS names to work beyond basic identities and social profiles into powerful digital service platforms for:

* Digital nomads
* Consultants
* AI agents
* Online businesses

This proposal seeks essential funding to expand what’s possible with ENS names and ensure they remain the industry standard for onchain naming.

Over the past year, we’ve developed innovative applications for onchain names, including fully tradable digital businesses and revenue-generating AI agents. We believe our unique experience positions us perfectly to help shape how ENS names will be used in real world applications going forward.

## 7. Scope of Work & Budget

### Why Expand ENS Utility?

ENS names have established themselves as the fundamental building blocks of identity in the Web3 ecosystem. However, their current utility is largely limited to basic wallet address resolution and simple profile information. Our proposal aims to significantly expand what ENS can do. With our proposed enhancements, service providers, businesses, and professionals would be able to use ENS profiles to solicit services, build social credit, and create a complete digital footprint. Your ENS name could become the center of your professional life online. This includes:

Service Offerings: Currently, ENS profiles contain limited information. Our proposal would transform them into complete professional hubs onchain.

We would enhance Profile Resolvers to track services tied directly to your domain. By adding capabilities for professional offerings, job listings, and collaboration requests to ENS profiles, we would create significantly more value. These changes would enable specialized marketplaces to emerge naturally from the ENS ecosystem. With these enhancements, your professional identity on your ENS profile would allow potential clients to discover you, verify your background, and engage your services through one consistent identity.

This would position ENS as a foundation for the emerging agent economy, where trusted professional identity becomes essential for both human and AI service providers.

Credit Score Building: Our proposal would enable businesses to use ENS profiles to document their transaction histories and build reputation over time, creating the groundwork for decentralized social credit systems based on actual performance.

The improved ENS system would allow tracking of business interactions, client relationships, and project completions within profiles, establishing verifiable records accessible to anyone. This would transform ENS into a transparent data source for assessing trustworthiness throughout Web3.

Digital Footprint Management: The professional world is currently fragmented. Your reputation is trapped in silos across platforms. Clients can’t easily find your complete story in one place. Our proposed ENS improvements would connect your work history, client feedback, and service offerings directly to your ENS name, creating a professional identity that travels with you. These expanded capabilities would make your achievements, skills, and services portable, verifiable, and permanent.

We believe that making ENS profiles more useful will bring more people into the Web3 ecosystem. By expanding what ENS can do beyond its current limitations, we open up new possibilities for everyone. This proposal focuses on creating new standards and building the infrastructure needed to make these ideas real. Our work is supported by rigorous R&D into use cases and technical feasibility, to develop solutions that address real needs and is easy to use/works well for users.
