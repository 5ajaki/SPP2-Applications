# 4.1 Scope of Work

**Requested amount**: $300,000\*

**Description of the service provided**:

DAOs work on coordinated governance. And governance is in the hands of tokenholders and as a collective unit, delegates. If tokenholders are inactive, governance is hampered.

**This is the problem we’ve identified – the problem of tokenholder activation.**

To address this, we aim to positively impact tokenholder activation.

If this is addressed, we believe it will set a flywheel and improve governance in this way:

> Tokenholders active → Delegate tokens → Delegators’ token allocation increases → Higher voting power → Active governance.

To achieve this ![:point_up:](https://discuss.ens.domains/images/emoji/twitter/point_up.png?v=12 ":point_up:"), we propose to build, distribute, and market – **ENSGov Navigator**.

[![ENS DAO Tooling Presentation (2)](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/e/e4db3b04ece3f9d92dcc81a353510bc23c49394e_2_517x291.jpeg)ENS DAO Tooling Presentation (2)1920×1080 104 KB](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/e/e4db3b04ece3f9d92dcc81a353510bc23c49394e.jpeg "ENS DAO Tooling Presentation (2)")

### Build

ENSGov Navigator will serve as the comprehensive governance analytics platform for the ENS DAO. This will consist of a:

1. **Social layer**: Where tokenholders can view delegate profiles, metrics (detailed below), and voting reasoning.
2. **Execution layer**: Where tokenholders can directly delegate their tokens to the respective delegates.

We will build a comprehensive ENS DAO governance analytics platform with six integrated components designed to enhance transparency, increase participation, and drive data-informed decisions.

The dashboard and execution layer will be divided into 3 categories:

> Full list of metrics is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cAnwCc0yHmL6u42nUOc9HPi3Tw_VCFsBHEE3hrFa6n0/edit?usp=sharing).

**– Category 1: Macro Governance.**

An overview of the governance process which will include top level metrics on – governance, delegation, voting power distribution and participation rates.

* Real-time dashboard displaying total proposals over time (incl temp checks and onchain activity)
* Active delegates and growth trends visualization
* Voting power distribution analytics
* Delegation patterns and centralization metrics
* Participation rates by proposal type

**– Category 2: Individual Delegates View**

A delegate-specific view that shows information on a per-delegate basis. We will initially build this out with onchain data only (including voting activity, alignment, influence) and later on add the ability for a delegate to provide qualitative profile-related information on core values, voting justification, etc.

* Transparent delegate performance tracking
* Voting activity metrics (votes made, missed, reasoning provided)
* Voting alignment metrics (contrarian ratio, late voting momentum)
* Influence metrics (voting power, delegation velocity)

**– Category 3: Proposal Specific Analytics**

A proposal-specific view shows information for each proposal based on key overarching metrics like voting result (For/Against/Abstain), quorum fulfilment, votes received, and more in-depth metrics, for instance, delegate behaviour, impact score, comparative analysis against similar proposals, etc.

* Voting breakdown by delegate categories
* Timeline of vote accumulation
* Proposal impact scoring for delegates
* Historical position search functionality
* Comparative analysis with similar proposals

### Distribute

**Multi-Channel Notification System**

To connect the governance tracking on ENSGov Navigator with social platforms where tokenholders remain active, we will distribute governance notifications from the Navigator to X and Telegram.

The messaging on these platforms will be divided into 3 modules:

– **Module 1: Pre-vote Updates**

This module will contain notifications about *new proposals only* and key details about them including – description, duration, outcome required for voting (votes required and quorum).

• New proposal created  

• Proposal details and links  

• Time until voting begins  

• Key changes being proposed

– **Module 2: Active Vote Updates**

This module will contain the bulk of the notification system, as it will inform the social communities about delegate voting behavior (including tokens used, concentration, contrarian ratio, if any), participation rates of voters, voting timings against time remaining, etc.

• Current vote tallies (For/Against)  

• Time remaining to vote  

• Quorum status  

• Major delegate votes  

• Participation milestones

– **Module 3: Post Vote Updates**

This module will track proposal results as a result of delegate voting behaviour and will inform the community of the result of a proposal and the leading force behind it.

• Final results, proposal passed/failed  

• Total participation stats by delegate  

• Delegate voting summary

### Market

To extract key findings from the delegate voting activity on proposals, we will generate quarterly research reports and monthly DAO roundups.

**Quarterly research reports**

These reports will analyse voting patterns among delegates and across proposal types using delegate effectiveness metrics at the end of every quarter. The conclusion we hope to draw is what kind of proposals are delegates voting on and how are they using their voting power across proposals to unveil patterns in voting behavior. We will benchmark ENS governance performance against other leading DAOs to identify industry best practices and improvement opportunities, if any.

The report concludes with data-driven recommendations specifically designed to increase participation rates and enhance decision-making processes within the ENS ecosystem.

**Monthly DAO roundups**

These roundups will provide thorough documentation of all ENS governance activities at the end of every month. Each roundup includes detailed written reports on proposal submissions, discussions, voting outcomes, and implementation status, complemented by accessible video summaries to broaden community understanding. We’ll highlight key metrics and emerging trends in governance participation.

## 4.3 Budget

Our estimated cost to build and maintain the ENSGov Navigator is **$240,000**, covering engineering, data infrastructure, product development, research, and distribution.

> The entire budget is detailed here → [ENS Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xLCNu3gAq9Rqjb2qHhUDMNlyEYmSj1Lswu6_zvmzwlw/edit?usp=sharing).

We’re requesting $240,000, even though the ENS Service Provider Program sets $300,000 as the minimum grant amount. This is a conscious decision. Our aim with the ENSGov Navigator is to build a solid delegation system, distribute it across key channels, market it meaningfully, and activate both inactive tokenholders and delegates.

We believe $240,000 is a fair and transparent ask for this scope. It reflects what we think it will reasonably cost to execute at a high standard, without overcharging the DAO. That said, we’re fully aligned with the community’s goals. If there’s interest in expanding the scope (additional analytics, deeper integrations, or governance education features) we’re open to community feedback and increase the offering to meet the $300,000 threshold.

Our goal, through this SPP program, is to deliver long-term value to the ENS DAO.
