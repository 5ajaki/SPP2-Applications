## 4. What We Do & Why It Matters

### 4.1 Making ENS More Engaging

While ENS record management is functional, we believe it can—and should—be far more engaging. For many users, especially those just getting started with Ethereum, getting an ENS name or subname is exciting… but that excitement often fades quickly if there’s nothing meaningful or fun to do with it.

At **Records.xyz**, we focus on turning that initial spark into **long-term interaction**. Our approach is to provide tools that make ENS names **feel like dynamic digital profiles**, not static wallet aliases.

We’ve already built and integrated into our platform:

* **ENSRedirect**, which lets users point their ENS name to any website—whether that’s a personal portfolio, a community page, a blog, or a startup.
* **AvatarSync**, which pulls avatars and banners from Twitter/X into your ENS profile, creating continuity between your Web2 and Web3 identity.

Coming soon in **Q2**, we’ll launch our **ENS Subdomains Bot**—a social entry point into ENS identities. Users will be able to generate a unique ENS subdomain just by replying to a tweet or tagging/mentioning the bot. This makes onboarding into ENS fun, viral, and accessible—no prior knowledge or dapp interaction required.

But we’re not the only ones building in this direction—and that’s a good thing. We’re excited about other teams creating tools around ENS records as well. A standout is **Webhash**, which lets users **build and deploy websites linked to their ENS names**. We’re looking forward to integrating such functionalities directly into Records.xyz.

This is just the beginning. As more teams begin to build expressive, creative, and playful tools around ENS records, we’ll be looking for opportunities to **collaborate, integrate, and support those efforts**. Because the more engaging ENS becomes, the more likely users are to keep exploring, customizing, and using their names in meaningful ways.

### 4.2 **Serving Users Where They Are**

One of the biggest changes in Ethereum over the past few years has been the rise of Layer 2 (L2) networks like Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum. These networks are often where users are **first onboarded**, especially in regions where affordability and usability are paramount. Yet most existing ENS tooling still assumes that users are on Ethereum mainnet, with gas and familiarity with L1 workflows. This assumption creates unnecessary friction.

We experienced this firsthand while onboarding users to ENS at a local Ethereum conference here in **East Africa**. Many attendees were new to Ethereum and received their first ENS name or subdomain through our team’s efforts. But the follow-up questions were almost always the same:

* *“How do I update my profile?”*
* *“I use Base/Optimism—can I manage my ENS there?”*
* *“I only have gas on L2—what now?”*
* *“Can I point my name to my website?”*

These weren’t edge cases—they were **recurring questions from real users**. And they revealed a major gap: users were excited about ENS, but **they didn’t know what to do with their name**, or couldn’t take the next step because the tools weren’t built for their context.

We believe that serving users means **meeting them where they are**, whether that’s on Base or OP or any other L2. That means supporting the networks they use, acknowledging their constraints, and giving them tools that work in their environment. It also means recognizing that **global adoption starts locally**, and building with real-world use cases—not just idealized user flows—in mind.

### 4.3 **A Single Place for All ENS Names**

The ENS ecosystem is expanding beyond mainnet, with different teams and networks launching their own ENS-compatible naming systems. While this diversity is powerful, it also introduces fragmentation—users now have ENS names issued from multiple sources, with no single place to manage them all.

**Records.xyz is designed to unify that experience.** Our vision is to be the **one interface** where users can manage all their ENS records—regardless of which network or resolver they’re tied to.

We’ve already added support for **Basenames**, the ENS subdomains under `base.eth` managed by the Base team. These are increasingly popular entry points into ENS for users on Base, and we make it easy to manage these subdomains just like you would a mainnet name.

Coming in **Q2**, we will be adding support for **Linea names** and other L2-based namespaces using **ENSNODE**, a new multichain indexer developed by **Namehash Labs**. We’re excited to integrate it and want to give a big shoutout to the Namehash Labs team for pioneering this important piece of infrastructure.

Another major development we’re tracking closely is the **Wildcard Writing ENSIP**, a newly released ENS standard that allows offchain names—like those managed by alternate resolvers and storage layers—to be updated in a trustless way. While it hasn’t yet been widely adopted, we anticipate that it will become a foundational part of how offchain ENS records are managed across the ecosystem.

We’re building with this standard in mind, so that once projects begin implementing it, **Records.xyz will be able to support managing records for offchain names just as easily as onchain ones**. One project we’re especially excited about here is **Namestone**, which is creating new types of ENS-compatible offchain names. We’re looking forward to supporting names issued by Namestone and other similar projects as they begin adopting Wildcard Writing.

By designing Records.xyz to support all of these namespaces, we’re ensuring that users don’t have to worry about where they acquired their name. They just log in, manage their profile, and use their name—**all in one place.**

### 4.4 **Committed to Integrations**

At Records.xyz, we’re building alongside the broader ENS and Ethereum community. Our platform is designed to **integrate, not compete** by supporting protocols, tools, and standards that expand what ENS names can do and how users can interact with them.

One example is our integration of **EFP**—shoutout to Brantly and his team for pushing social primitives forward onchain. EFP is a native Ethereum standard that enables users to **follow and tag addresses**, making it possible to build a decentralized social graph. Users on Records.xyz can already see their **follower and following counts** when viewing their ENS profile. Once public profiles are live, they’ll also be able to **follow other ENS users directly from our app**, bringing social connection into the ENS experience.

We also love seeing the creative ways people use our tools in the wild. With **ENSRedirect**, users can point their ENS name to any custom URL. A fun example: **`trumpcoin.eth` and `worldliberty.eth` have both redirected their ENS names to their respective project websites using ENSRedirect**. And yes, for the curious—we’ve confirmed internally that they did in fact use our tool to set those redirects. It’s always exciting to see ENS being used to signal alignment or add a touch of legitimacy.

### 4.5 **Driving Local Adoption**

To meaningfully grow ENS adoption, we must go beyond crypto-native circles and reach users in communities where web3 is still emerging. Our team has been deeply engaged in local outreach, particularly in **East Africa**, where we’ve actively onboarded users to ENS through conferences and community events.

In these settings, we’ve often provided users with **free subdomains** as an easy first step into the ENS ecosystem. While many were excited and grateful to receive an identity they could immediately use, we also encountered a recurring sentiment: **some users wanted their own full ENS name** (a level 2 `.eth` name), not just a subdomain. However, purchasing a `.eth` name requires an **onchain transaction on Ethereum mainnet**, which presents both financial and technical barriers—especially in markets where L1 gas fees are prohibitive and crypto onramps are limited.

To address this gap, we will work towards integrating **MPESA**, the dominant mobile money system in Kenya. This will allow users to **purchase `.eth` names directly using local currency**, without needing to interact with exchanges or bridge funds. We believe this will significantly lower the barrier to meaningful ENS ownership and provide a smoother, more culturally relevant onboarding experience.

This initiative is part of our **Extended Scope** and contributes to the increased budget request under that scope. Facilitating onchain `.eth` name purchases on behalf of users will require us to maintain **liquidity and operational infrastructure** to complete these transactions reliably. We see this as a key step in making ENS truly accessible at the global level, while also supporting the DAO’s revenue through new name registrations.

  → GitHub: [GitHub - WildcardLabs/records.xyz](https://github.com/WildcardLabs/records.xyz)
* **L2 Crosschain Resolver** – A key piece of infrastructure that allows users to set ENS records on L2s with full Ethereum security guarantees using storage proofs. This work emerged from both technical R&D and conversations with users who couldn’t afford L1 gas.
* **ENSRedirect** – A tool allowing users to point ENS names to any website. This feature is live and in use today. Projects like `trumpcoin.eth` and `worldliberty.eth` have used ENSRedirect to link their ENS names to their project websites. (Confirmed by our team.)  
  
  Website: <https://ensredirect.xyz>. (Integration also live on records.xyz)
* **AvatarSync** – Enables users to sync their ENS profile avatar and banner from Twitter/X. This makes ENS feel more like a modern Web2/3 identity layer, which was one of the most common requests in our early research.  
  
  Website: <https://avatarsync.io> (Integration also live on records.xyz)
* **ENS Subdomains Bot** *(launching Q2)* – A social onboarding experiment that will allow users to mint ENS subdomains by replying to a tweet. This tool is built from direct feedback about onboarding friction, especially for new users who wanted a fast, gasless entry point.
* **ENSRegistry**, which began as a Twitter bot for tracking newly registered ENS domains and subdomains. It has since evolved into a full web app—**[ensregistry.xyz](https://ensregistry.xyz)**—that tracks ENS registrations in real time.

**Optimism DAO Grant (2023)** – We received a grant from Optimism DAO to develop the Optimism L2 Resolver. This foundational work helped pave the way for our current Crosschain Resolver and is directly linked to our L2-native ENS strategy.

## 8. Conflict Of Interest Statement

Wildcard Labs has no conflicts of interest to declare. None of our team members are currently serving as stewards or hold compensated positions at ENS Labs or Karpatkey, apart from our role as a current ENS DAO service provider. We are solely focused on building Records.xyz and are not involved with any other candidate projects in the Service Provider Program.

We previously received a grant from the Optimism DAO over a year ago to support the development of our Optimism L2 Resolver, which laid the groundwork for the Crosschain Resolver now used in Records.xyz. This work is foundational to our current focus on L2-native ENS record management and does not represent an active funding relationship or overlapping engagement.
