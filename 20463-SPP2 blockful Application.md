## **1. Applicant Information**

1. **blockful**
2. **Website**: [blockful.io](http://blockful.io)
3. **Primary Contact/entity ENS Name**:

blockful.eth

4. **Primary Contact(s)**

netto.eth | [telegram](https://t.me/alextnetto)

5. **Company Overview**

Blockful is a team who have been contributing to ENS development since 2022. We’ve evolved from protocol contributors to governance security specialists, combining deep smart contract expertise with advanced research methodologies to anticipate and neutralize governance attack vectors before they materialize.

Our proven track record includes identifying and preventing a potential governance attack in 2 DAOs.

6. **Requested Amount**:

Basic budget: 400k  

Extended budget: 700k total

7. **Size of team and commitment**

In the last 2 year, blockful has +90% of metagov and ecosystem call attendence. That’s just one simple example to show our presence and constant commitment with ENS.

Beside dedicating to ENS protocol development, our main work as an organization has been around governance security — not just for ENS, but also for other DAOs like Uniswap and Optimism, with more on the way. This gives us the hands-on experience to build mature, reliable tools. The entire team is involved in the scope for this proposal:

* 2 Full-stack Engineers
* 2 Back-end/Smart Contract eng
* 2 Front-ends
* 1 Tech lead
* 1 PM
* 1 PO
* 1 Product Designer
* 1 Governance researcher

As we are **totally bootstrapped**, never having raised a penny from investors, this funding is crucial for us to focus on ENS and effectively address this major security problem. For that we also need to be competitive, retain and build a world-class team for the long-term.

2.4. **OFAC Sanctions Compliance**

* We, Blockful, confirm that neither our organization nor any of our employees, contractors, or executive leadership is located in, or a resident of, an OFAC-sanctioned country. We further confirm that none of our business resources are derived from or routed through any country or entity that is subject to sanctions imposed by the United States (OFAC) or equivalent regulatory bodies. We pledge to remain compliant with all applicable sanctions laws and will promptly notify the ENS DAO if our status changes.

2.5. **Multi Year Stream Eligibility**

#### Here is a great overview of what we did last year as a SP

* [Application for SPP1](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/service-provider-stream-nomination-thread/18142/38)
* [Quarterly reports thread](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/blockful-service-provider-reports/19553) (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
* [Public task management](https://github.com/orgs/blockful-io/projects/6)
* [Improving Management of Domains (talk @ frENSday)](https://youtu.be/4DQAAttk63k) - **ELI5 about ENSIP-20**

For full transparency, the research and creation of the Security Council for preventing a governance attack was out of the scope of our SPP1 and paid as bug bounty.

## **3. Open Source Commitment**

We are committed to build high quality open-source, not only having our code but also our [task management public](https://github.com/orgs/blockful-io/projects/6/views/1), bringing transparency, accountability.

[![image](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/1/168779c4bc9569f62813de26904bbeb0f9f64a2b_2_518x499.png)image740×714 57.9 KB](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/1/168779c4bc9569f62813de26904bbeb0f9f64a2b.png "image")  

*In 1 year and 1 month of work, we have done 365 tasks, all open, verifiable and organized.*

All code and tools developed under this program will be made available under the MIT license and hosted in public GitHub repositories under the Blockful organization. Also maintaining comprehensive documentation to support adoption by the ENS and wider ecosystem.

## **4. Scope of Work & Budget**

Our service provider program for 2025 focuses on two goals on critical areas:

**Goal #1 - Governance Security**

#### ENS DAO is in a [vulnerable position](https://mirror.xyz/research.blockful.eth/-PfMduhpxdypPrutofr6099T4ROpsAmX0fPNbvDgR_k) for a governance attack, and if we don’t take the actions needed before the security council expires, it will happen.

> We have around 480 days to work on it.  
> 
> [![image](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/9/9bc5313f9b7d370463c7c4731bd2e471c76c4070_2_690x361.png)image854×448 21 KB](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/9/9bc5313f9b7d370463c7c4731bd2e471c76c4070.png "image")

Our goal is to **reach a point where a security council is no longer necessary.** Achieving this demands significant research and engineering efforts to tackle the problem from every possible angle. And it’s probably an effort that takes more than 1 year.

If you wanna understand in depth, [here](https://mirror.xyz/research.blockful.eth/-PfMduhpxdypPrutofr6099T4ROpsAmX0fPNbvDgR_k) is our research that led to the creation of the Security Council. And [here](https://anticapture.com/ens) is the first version of Anticapture, already showing risks that ENS DAO have.

**Goal #2 - Protocol Development**

Now that [EIP-7884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7884) and [ENSIP-20](https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/20) where shipped by our team, after 1 year of research, prototyping and iterating with the community. We need efforts for the adoption of the standard.

Only with adoption we can unlock the benefits of making any domain (onchain and offchain) being managable on ENS manager app, ENSjs and much easier integration between them all (base, linea, uniswap, namespace, namestone and etc).

If you wanna understand in depth, [here](https://youtu.be/4DQAAttk63k) is our presentation at frENS day (which is a great ELI5).

### **4.1 Basic Scope of Work**

#### **4.1.1 ENSIP-20 Wildcard Writing Implementation** → Goal #2 - Protocol Development

*Impact: Supporting ENS Labs and subdomain providers to integrate and adapt for ENSIP-20, enabling universal domain management.*

1. We are already working to [integrate it into ENSjs](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs/pull/226), so ENS Labs can integrate with the manager app.
2. Any offchain domain could be managed by users on ens.app. Any dev could easly integrate it’s app to manage any domain with ENSjs. Unlocking huge network effects.
3. Help offchain domain providers to adopt ENSIP-20 into their infrastructure. This means studying their infrastructure and guiding the to adapt. This can vary from support meetings to us creating smart contract for them. Linea and Base teams were involved in our early iterations on the standard and were waiting for it to advance.
4. Maintaing documentation and repos with working examples for backend, smart contract and frontend implementations
5. Maintaining the frontend ([name.ful.xyz](https://name.ful.xyz/)) and gateways currently running in production

| Quarter | KPIs |
| --- | --- |
| Q1 | ENSIP specification documentation completed - Initial ENSjs integration live |
| Q2\* | Complete implementation with ENSjs + integrating ENSjs into our frontend for testing usability |
| Q3\* | Integration with at least 2 major subdomain providers (base.eth or uni.eth for example) - Developer documentation and examples published |
| Q4\* | Full integration support for ENS Manager App and ENSv2 - 3+ production implementations in ecosystem |

\*Some KPIs inevitably depend on third-parties progress

#### 4.1.2 **Calldata and Proposal Review** → Goal #1 - Governance Security

*Impact: Providing critical security validation for executable proposals to prevent catastrophic errors or malicious code execution. **One simple error on a proposal can cost millions.***

Our past SPP term also had this scope, which had great feedback from delegates, for feeling more secure on voting and understanding what’s happening. The work developed can be found in [this](https://github.com/blockful-io/dao-proposals/tree/main/src/ens/proposals) repo, and it’s where we’ll continue to work on.

* Structured SLA commitment:
  + Initial assessment for giving the review’s timeline within 3 business days
  + Review’s timeline ranging from 1 day to 2 weeks, determined by calldata complexity and our familiarity with the contracts involved
* Two-stage review process:
  + First review when executable proposal is posted on the forum (requires properly tagged proposals with included calldata)
  + Final verification when proposal goes on-chain (critical security checkpoint)
* The review is a set ot tests that execute proposals and validate the differences on functionality and states environments to verify intended outcomes. [Here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-6-x-executable-endowment-permissions-to-karpatkey-update-5/20204/3) is a great example.
* We’ll provide technical details about the calldata on the proposal, if not provided by the proposer. This will help non-technical delegates to understand what is executed.

| Quarter | KPIs |
| --- | --- |
| Q1 | Response to 100% of tagged proposals within SLA |
| Q2 | Response to 100% of tagged proposals within SLA |
| Q3 | Response to 100% of tagged proposals within SLA |
| Q4 | Response to 100% of tagged proposals within SLA |

#### 4.1.3 **Anticapture Integration** → Goal #1 - Governance Security

*Impact: Building a complete monitoring system to prevent governance attacks based on research.*

> 
> These are screenshots from [anticapture.com](https://anticapture.com/ens), with real-time data. And it shows how concerning the current situation is.

* Actions for security improvements need to be data-driven recommendations, if not, this **can cost us resources, time, and ultimately a governance attack**
* Simplify understanding for delegates about risks, redelegations, historical data. Visualizations and data you don’t get anywhere else in today tools.
* This is specific and valuable data, that you would need to attack the DAO or, to understand how to defend as well. Here, we wanna give the importance needed to make sure ENS defends first.

> It’s **similar to L2beat** in the sense that it’s not just data-driven — it’s **deeply grounded in research**. We’ve analyzed over 30 governance attacks, and the metrics and framework we’ve built are directly informed by those findings.

| Quarter | KPIs |
| --- | --- |
| Q1 | Deploy ENS DAO prototype with core governance risk metrics and actionable security insights. |
| Q2 | Deliver the final DAO Security Staging Framework – Like L2beat – in the ENS dashboard, publicly assessing governance maturity across risk |
| Q3 | More visibility around treasury and token markets - crucial for security metrics |
| Q4 | Show risk relevant transactions and integrating offchain voting data |

> This data intensive product has high infrastructure cost, RPC requests, database, servers. All of this for dev, staging and production environments.

Basic budget: $400k

### **4.2 Extended Scope of Work**

There are two options for ENS DAO to not suffer a governance attack:

1. Depend on the security council and renew it.
2. Proactively solving and attacking this problem on different fronts, based on specialized research.

Here, we are exploring option 2.

#### 4.2.1 **Governor Contract Security Improvements** → Goal #1 - Governance Security

> Screenshot from [anticapture.com](https://anticapture.com/ens). These initial risk assessement comes from research, studying other governor contracts and mapping what are parameters on governance implementation that increase risks for gov attacks.  
> 
> [![image](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/optimized/2X/7/716312262e1d2305f682edf1d7d560262c7bfedb_2_690x250.png)image1832×664 57.9 KB](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/7/716312262e1d2305f682edf1d7d560262c7bfedb.png "image")

*Impact: Increase our security level on governance implementation. Go from **high** risk to **low** risk.*

1. anticapture dashboard and research will give us what needed to change
2. Then iterating with the community to gather feedback, if there are more changes or consideration about the recommendations
3. Implement changes and ship a new governor, well tested, fixing if needed after audit and only stopping when implemented onchain

| Quarter | KPIs |
| --- | --- |
| Q1 | Report on recommendations for governor changes |
| Q2 | Have consensus with the community about changes |
| Q3 | Governor ready to audit |
| Q4 | Onchain deploy |

We do think this whole process will take less and we’ll aim for that, since it’s a security concern.

#### 4.2.2 **Delegation Incentives System** → Goal #1 - Governance Security

*Impact: Creating solutions to meaningfully increase delegation rates. This is the core need for not depending on the Security Council*

> We don’t know how this scope will be exactly because it needs to be built with the community and research a lot. What we commit is bringing suggestion based on research and to create whatever scope DAO decides that is necessary to tackle this problem.

* Research different methods and iterate with the DAO to choose a path. This will take at least 2 months of research.
* End-to-end development of delegation incentive mechanisms
* Indexer systems to determine fair distribution
* Smart contracts for secure fund distribution
* Interface for claiming incentives

| Quarter | KPIs |
| --- | --- |
| Q1 | Report about research on effective delegation incentive models |
| Q2\* | Iteration with community, definition of the scope to be executed |
| Q3\* | Deliver scope |
| Q4\* | **Increasing our delegated supply by 30%** (without the veto council) |

\*Some KPIs depend on third-party decisions and can be delayed. We’ll aim to execute it

#### 4.2.3 **Reliable Notification System** → Goal #1 - Governance Security

*Impact: Developing a reliable multi-platform and alert infrastructure that ensures no stakeholder misses critical governance actions.*

* Integration with email, Telegram, Slack, and Discord
* Alerts for delegators (token holders) about how their delegates voted
* Reminders for delegates about pending votes
* Voting confirmation feedback to verify transaction success
* Support for both onchain and offchain votes

| Quarter | KPIs |
| --- | --- |
| Q1 | Telegram integration for onchain voting reminder and token holder to warn about inactivity of their delegate |
| Q2 | Integrating email, discord and slack |
| Q3 | Support offchain votes, uptime 99% |
| Q4 | Notify security thread from anticapture and uptime 99% |

#### 4.2.4 **Security Council needs** → Goal #1 - Governance Security

*Impact: Keeps the DAO safe, if anticapture shows that we’re still depending on the security council and it’s near it’s expiration.*

When get ~3 months close to the Security Council expiration, action is needed:

* Research and report about the necessity of renewing the security council

If the DAO is still in a vulnerable situation:

* Discuss with the community about the composition and selection of security council members
* Redeploy Security Council contract
* Propose on chain the renewal of permissions for the contract

| Quarter | KPIs |
| --- | --- |
| Q4 | Report about necessity of renewing the security council |

---

**Extended budget:** $300k additional funding ($700k in total)

### 4.3 Second Year Stream Scope of Work

The scope for the second year, if selected, would be focused on:

* Smart Contracts for Namechain governance, which would enable the DAO to vote on L2 and execute on L1. This requires extensive research, discussion and testing.
* Maintaining and evolve all the product above so they are reliable and accurate.
* Continuing to secure DAO operations through proposals calldata review
* The governance security work needed is probably bigger than we imagine, and we only stop when the anticapture dashboard tell us the DAO is secure.

## **7. Conflict of Interest Statement**

#### 7.1. Conflicts of interest

Blockful acknowledges that our founder and CEO, netto.eth, currently serves as a metagov steward (term 6) and as a member of the ENS Security Council.

As stewards oversee service providers, netto’s dual role requires clear separation of responsibilities. To address this, Blockful commits to:

* Having netto recuse himself from any steward discussions or votes related to our service provider application or performance evaluation
* Maintaining transparent reporting of all service provider deliverables
* Implementing independent review processes for governance-related deliverables to ensure objectivity

We believe netto’s ecosystem involvement strengthens our ability to serve ENS effectively, while maintaining appropriate boundaries between his different roles.

#### 7.2. Fundraising

Blockful is fully bootstrapped with shareholders consisting exclusively of current and former team members. We have never raised external investment even with strong interest, though we may open this oportunity in the future.

#### 7.3. Revenue Structure

Our revenue currently comes from service contracts with various DAOs and Web3 projects, primarily focused on governance security and DAO tooling. As a team of 11 professionals with office space and standard operational expenses (legal, tax, administrative, infrastructure), we maintain a lean but sustainable operation with over 12 months of runway. We are currently profitable and financially self-sufficient.

Blockful have done an outstanding job this past year, particularly in examining and verifying executable proposal payloads, and providing tools that allow other participants to independently verify the proposals. They’ve also done sterling work building out ENSIP-20, which will help hugely with user-interface integration for cross-chain names.

Their proposed scope of work for the next two years looks exciting, and focuses on real issues affecting the DAO. I’m excited to see them execute on it and am happy to endorse them as a service provider.
