### 4.0 How Funding JustaName will advance the ENS Ecosystem

Our strategy focuses on onboarding high-value accounts—those with substantial existing audiences and user bases—because we believe that the next 100 million onchain users will be brought by the brands and organizations who already have them online. We deliver a uniquely scalable and robust platform designed to bridge ENS protocol and Namechain directly to enterprise-scale adoption, ensuring reliability and seamless industry integration.

Our moonshot goal is to issue one million subnames through our platform. While ambitious, we believe this vision is achievable by consistently building value-driven partnerships. The ripple effects of achieving this goal extend far beyond our platform, if we can issue millions of subnames, we will create millions in ARR for ENS DAO because a large percentage of subnames users are first time ENS users. Activating these users via offchain names will inevitably drive many toward purchasing second-level ENS names, directly monetizing the DAO.

Today, building an ENS-centric company remains challenging in a restrictive investor climate. However, our project is dedicated to changing this narrative. ENS support during these early, formative stages is crucial to overcoming current funding constraints and fully realizing our pioneering vision.

### 4.1 Basic Scope of Work

**Requested amount:** $400,000

     JustaName is building towards a future where businesses can issue ENS-powered identities that effortlessly function as self-custodial wallets. Initially, these identities will be issued offchain, allowing businesses immediate scalability and frictionless onboarding. Upon the launch of ENSv2 on Namechain, the focus will progressively shift toward fully decentralized, onchain issuance. Businesses will simply issue a name, preconfigured with addresses across selected chains, transforming onboarding into an intuitive, identity-first experience. Users will interact seamlessly with their digital identity, free from the complexities of managing wallets or keys. By integrating this process with our verification systems, we’re creating a holistic identity layer that simplifies adoption while preserving the core benefits of self-custody and user control.
   
   Components: The system integrates **ENS** as the foundational identity layer, with **DFNS** serving as the Key Management System (KMS). On top of this, a **smart contract account** architecture enables advanced functionality such as \*\*\*\*batch transactions. It leverages **EIP-7702** for delegated execution and **EIP-4337** for gas sponsorship, utilizing existing infrastructure.
   
   **Why is this valuable to ENS?**  
   
   This approach positions JustaName to broadly appeal to any company worldwide by significantly lowering the barriers for adopting ENS technology. It allows businesses—even those without Web3 expertise—to seamlessly issue and manage digital identities, thus making ENS accessible and relevant across traditional and emerging industries. Essentially, it opens the door for global, widespread distribution of ENS-based technology.
   
   * **Deep Data Analytics:** Deliver advanced insights for workspace owners by harnessing onchain data from ENS profiles, issued subnames, and verification records. Our analytics suite helps organizations understand engagement patterns and measure adoption across segments, transforming blockchain data into business intelligence.
