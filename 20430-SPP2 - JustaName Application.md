### **Company Overview:**

At JustaName, we believe ENS is the identity layer of the internet. Our mission is to make that identity programmable, contextual, and accessible at scale. To achieve this, we’re building the **User State Layer**: a programmable interface for ENS identities that enables meaningful, user-centric experiences across wallets, dApps, and enterprise ecosystems.

We turn raw ENS names into full digital identities — enabling verifications, preferences, engagement tracking, and secure interactions — without compromising on decentralization. This empowers developers and businesses to create experiences that are technically robust and socially engaging.

ENS namespaces serve as the foundation for intuitive, personalized, and interoperable digital journeys. By abstracting protocol complexity and offering streamlined SDKs, dashboards, and plug-and-play modules, JustaName accelerates adoption while preserving the neutrality and openness of ENS.

Our platform is composed of three strategic layers:

**Infrastructure**

Our backend architecture is the foundation that powers the entire JustaName ecosystem. It features scalable microservices and high-performance systems for offchain ENS subname issuance, decentralized identity orchestration, and real-time data analytics. To ensure full transparency and decentralization, we leverage OrbisDB on the Ceramic Network to publish subname events, creating a tamper-resistant audit trail while maintaining a smooth, consistent developer experience. This resilient architecture ensures every integration built on top is both secure and scalable.

**Applications**

Built atop this infrastructure is our ENS Identity Platform: a comprehensive suite of tools that makes it easy to manage, extend, and integrate ENS-based identities. It includes:

* A user-friendly **Dashboard** for configuring second-level domains and generating API keys
* Three SDKs—**Core, React, and Plug-n-Play**—to support both custom and rapid deployment paths
* A powerful **Console** to generate embeddable widget code with minimal effort
* An integrated **Explorer** for controlled experimentation and live QA workflows

These tools abstract away protocol complexity, allowing developers and teams to focus on creating delightful user experiences without sacrificing control or flexibility.

**Enterprise Adoption**

We believe the next 100 million onchain users won’t come from crypto-native communities alone—they’ll be onboarded by the companies that already own digital distribution and user trust. But to realize this, ENS must become accessible to any company, not just those already aligned with Web3. That’s why we’re building **identity-powered wallets**: offchain-issued, self-custodial ENS names that double as intuitive user wallets—no seed phrases, no friction, no complexity.

This unlocks a fundamentally new distribution model for ENS: one where any business can issue digital identities preconfigured for wallet functionality, user verification, and onchain access. It transforms ENS from a naming system into a globally distributed, programmable identity layer. By offering enterprise-ready tools to manage, monitor, and analyze user engagement, JustaName bridges traditional systems with the decentralized web—enabling brands to meet users where they are, and bring them fully onchain.

**One Identity at a Time**

Every layer of JustaName is deeply aligned with ENS—extending its reach, simplifying its adoption, and amplifying its impact. We aren’t just building on ENS. We’re building *for* ENS, and with the right support, we can help ENS scale to millions of new users—one identity at a time.

### **Requested Amount:**

* Basic scope: $300,000

### **Size of team and commitment:**

Our dedicated team of 10 professionals works full-time on JustaName, organized into specialized functional teams.

## 3. Open Source Commitment

JustaName is firmly committed to the open source ecosystem. JustVerified, our social verification infrastructure that enables users to link their social identities (Twitter, GitHub, Discord, etc.) to their ENS names, is already fully open source under MIT license. Additionally, all our SDKs and toolkit components, including the Multi-level SDKs and JustWeb3 framework, are open source and available for community use and contribution.

While we plan to progressively open-source our entire infrastructure stack as the project matures, we have intentionally delayed open-sourcing certain critical components until comprehensive security audits are completed. Ensuring user safety and data security remains our top priority, and we believe audits are an essential step prior to releasing sensitive infrastructure publicly.

Our codebase will continue to be accessible through public GitHub repositories, ensuring transparency and encouraging collaboration. Our open-source ethos extends beyond code sharing—we actively develop public goods for the ENS ecosystem, including:

* ENSvolution, an interactive tool for visualizing the evolution of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) profiles over time.
* MPC-TSS solutions specifically designed for CCIP-Read, providing more robust and secure offchain resolutions
* An extensible Plugin system enabling community-driven extensions of ENS functionality

We firmly believe that an open-source approach, combined with rigorous safety practices, is essential to foster trust, innovation, and widespread adoption of ENS technology.

## 4. Scope of Work & Budget

### 4.0 How Funding JustaName will advance the ENS Ecosystem

Our strategy focuses on onboarding high-value accounts—those with substantial existing audiences and user bases—because we believe that the next 100 million onchain users will be brought by the brands and organizations who already have them online. We deliver a uniquely scalable and robust platform designed to bridge ENS protocol and Namechain directly to enterprise-scale adoption, ensuring reliability and streamlined industry integration.

However, reaching this vision is challenging if we limit our focus to companies already aligned with Web3—those whose users already have wallets. This significantly narrows the scope of impact. To truly scale ENS adoption, we need to make it accessible to *any* company, regardless of their technical familiarity with crypto. That’s why we’re building **identity-powered wallets**: a system where businesses can issue ENS-based digital identities that function as wallets from day one, without requiring users to manage keys or understand blockchain infrastructure.

Our moonshot goal is to issue one million subnames through our platform. While ambitious, we believe this vision is achievable by consistently building value-driven partnerships. The ripple effects of achieving this goal extend far beyond our platform, if we can issue millions of subnames, we will create millions in ARR for ENS DAO because a large percentage of subnames users are first time ENS users. Activating these users via offchain names will inevitably drive many toward purchasing second-level ENS names, directly monetizing the DAO.

Today, building an ENS-centric company remains challenging in a restrictive investor climate. Our project is dedicated to changing this narrative. ENS support during these early, formative stages is crucial to overcoming current funding constraints and fully realizing our pioneering vision.

### 4.1 Scope of Work

**Requested amount:** $300,000

**Description:**  

The basic scope focuses on maintaining, enhancing, and expanding core JustaName platform functionalities while developing essential public goods to benefit the ENS ecosystem:

   * Improve SIWENS (Sign In With ENS) for decentralized server-side authorization
   * Refine JustWeb3 Plug-n-Play SDK for simplified ENS integrations
   * JustaNameResolverV2: A highly optimized and scalabale version of our offchain resolver.
2. **Public Goods Development:**
   
   * **ENSvolution roadmap**: Enhance [ENSvolution](https://www.ensvolution.xyz/) to provide deeper insights into the complete lifecycle of ENS names. Our roadmap includes visualizing ownership transfers, monitoring renewal events, integrating historical sale price data, and supporting offchain names through our standardized indexing system. We’ll also implement analytics for trend analysis, comparative tools for examining multiple ENS names, and developer APIs for ecosystem integration. These improvements will transform ENSvolution from a profile history tool into a comprehensive ENS analytics platform serving both individual users and enterprise adopters.
   * **Finalize and Standardize Event-Based Indexing for Offchain Names:** Complete the standardization process for the proposed offchain subname events system, which will provide a consistent format and API for tracking creation, updates, and deletions. This approach will enable efficient indexing through a provider-agnostic discovery mechanism and standardized endpoint, eliminating the need for continuous polling while maintaining flexibility in backend implementation choices.
   * **MPC-TSS for CCIP-Read**: Fully implement Multi-Party Computation Threshold Signatures (MPC-TSS) for robust, secure offchain resolutions. Instead of relying on a single signer, this distributed signing approach enhances resilience, security, and fault-tolerance, significantly mitigating single points of failure and ensuring high availability and trustworthiness of offchain data.
   
   **Advanced Public Goods:**
   
   * **Encrypted Solutions:** Enable users to encrypt and securely share sensitive, private, or confidential data points within their ENS text records exclusively with designated ENS names (people, organizations, or even AI agents), enhancing privacy, granular access control, and secure data management.
   * **AI x Identity:** Leverage the aforementioned encrypted solutions to develop frameworks to embed user context directly into ENS profiles, enabling personalized LLM experiences while removing the need to expose sensitive user context to external LLM providers. This approach empowers users with full control over their personal data, significantly enhancing privacy, autonomy, and data sovereignty.
3. **JustaName Platform Enhancement:**
   
   * **Identity-Powered Wallet Infrastructure:**  
     
     JustaName is building towards a future where businesses can issue ENS-powered identities that effortlessly function as self-custodial wallets. Initially, these identities will be issued offchain, allowing businesses immediate scalability and frictionless onboarding. Upon the launch of ENSv2 on Namechain, the focus will progressively shift toward fully decentralized, onchain issuance. Businesses will simply issue names, preconfigured with addresses across selected chains, transforming onboarding into an intuitive, identity-first experience. Users will interact intuitively with their digital identity, free from the complexities of managing wallets or keys. By integrating this process with our verification systems, we’re creating a holistic identity layer that simplifies adoption while preserving the core benefits of self-custody and user control.
     
     **Components**: The system integrates **ENS** as the foundational identity layer, with **DFNS** serving as the Key Management System (KMS). On top of this, a **smart contract account** architecture enables advanced functionality such as batch transactions. It leverages **EIP-7702** for delegated execution and **EIP-4337** for gas sponsorship, utilizing existing infrastructure.
     
     **Why is this valuable to ENS?**  
     
     This approach positions JustaName to broadly appeal to any company worldwide by significantly lowering the barriers for adopting ENS technology. It allows businesses—even those without Web3 expertise—to issue and manage digital identities with minimal friction, thus making ENS accessible and relevant across traditional and emerging industries. Essentially, it opens the door for global, widespread distribution of ENS-based technology.
   * **Deep Data Analytics:** Deliver advanced insights for workspace owners by harnessing onchain data from ENS profiles, issued subnames, and verification records. Our analytics suite helps organizations understand engagement patterns and measure adoption across segments, transforming blockchain data into business intelligence. This data-driven approach supports strategic decision-making and enhances personalized engagement for companies while respecting user privacy.
     
     **Why is this valuable to ENS?**  
     
     By providing organizations with measurable engagement patterns and adoption metrics derived from ENS profiles, analytics position ENS as a strategic asset rather than just a technical solution. This transforms ENS into essential infrastructure for businesses, deepens long-term organizational commitment, and accelerates ecosystem growth by demonstrating practical, real-world value and fostering network effects across diverse sectors.
4. **Enterprise Onboarding:**
   
   * Actively onboard enterprises and notable Web3 brands for ENS integration.
