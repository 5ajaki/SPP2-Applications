## 2. Eligibility Confirmation

1. Company Age & Reputation

* x23.ai was founded in August 2023 (1 year, 8 months ago).
* We’ve been building out our products from day 1, working closely with DAO contributors and delegates. We’ve received multiple grants from various DAOs including Reserve Protocol, Lido, Aave, Optimism, Arbitrum, and ENS (metagov + small grants).
* Side note: Our first grant was actually from ENS public goods (see ‘[funded by’](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd48FbAF788EE2831086F074c208CD90269eAD050))!
* We’ve been supported by the [q/acc accelerator](https://q-acc.giveth.io/project/x23ai), [Octant Accelerator](https://x.com/OctantApp/status/1839274227796685154), and the Arbitrum Trailblazer program.

2. Team Experience

* I’ve been in the crypto space since 2014, contracting for Coinbase (2015), researching dynamic bonding curves (2018), deploying the first mainnet defi collateral swap (2020), and was an early engineer (4th) at Aave.
* I’m a full stack developer, handling both infra, code, and smart contracts. Constantly wearing many hats!
* Have been giving talks and presentations on various topics in the defi and blockchain/crypto space. E.g. [1](https://ethcc.io/archives/using-offchain-analytics-and-ai-for-the-health-of-protocols), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UzyLpUCXB0&t=751s), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7MKhv3r96Y), [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodSe8E2zzQ)

3. ENS Token Endorsement Requirement

* Secured endorsement from [@griff](/u/griff), who has >50k delegated ENS tokens.

4. OFAC Sanctions Compliance

* We, x23.ai, confirm that neither our organization nor any of our employees, contractors, or executive leadership is located in, or a resident of, an OFAC-sanctioned country. We further confirm that none of our business resources are derived from or routed through any country or entity that is subject to sanctions imposed by the United States (OFAC) or equivalent regulatory bodies. We pledge to remain compliant with all applicable sanctions laws and will promptly notify the ENS DAO if our status changes.

## 3. Open Source Commitment

All new work detailed in this application will be made available on Github under MIT license.

## 4. Scope of Work & Budget

### 4.1 Basic Scope of Work

* Requested amount: $300,000

The goals for our services to the ENS DAO and community are:

* To create more informed community members and delegates, and
* To increase DAO revenue by ensuring the ENS stack is accessible to AI agents and new AI economies.

To achieve this we will deliver the following:

**Copilot for ENS**

An open source chat interface that delegates or community members can use to get the most relevant information on proposals, development updates, and general information on ENS. This would be similar to ChatGPT, but focused specifically on ENS and custom made for the needs of the ENS community, iterated based on feedback.

The goal for this tool is to reduce the time commitment and cognitive load on delegates and participants, helping them to stay informed and up to date with everything ENS related.

Delegates will be able to dive deep into proposals, discover the lifecycle of the proposals and the surrounding context, as well as draw from historic data across discussions and onchain/offchain proposals.

Community members will be able to easily onboard into the DAO, learn about ENS domains, how to integrate, and ways they can contribute.

The tool will be capable of running locally, with configurable options to preserve privacy for users (e.g. selection of hosted/local LLMs, data sources, etc).

We’re able to deliver on this as we’ve already created an early version of this on Telegram, the ENS Wizard: [Telegram: Launch @ENSWizardBot](https://t.me/ENSWizardBot), used by some members of the ENS community.

**ENS for AI**

We will create (and maintain) open source plugins, tools, and integrations into the leading agent frameworks and LLM platforms. We will go to where the AI agents and AI developers already are, instead of making them come to us (or the ENS docs).

This will ensure the ENS stack (registration, decoding of names, etc) is available to agents now and in the future, increasing the potential revenue of the DAO and increasing the surface area of potential monetisation.

At a minimum, this will include integration into leading frameworks such as ElizaOS, [MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) servers, [GPTs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpts/), open source [tool calling](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/chat/function_calling/) integrations, and any other leading frameworks that appear in 2025.

We’re able to deliver on this as we have experience building similar tooling as part of the x23.ai stack, and have previously deployed a number of widely used open source [code](https://github.com/mrdavey/ez-flashloan) [examples](https://github.com/aave/flashloan-box).

**Why Us?**

The above scope of work is mutually beneficial to ENS and x23.ai, since we have already been building AI tools for delegates and DAOs for nearly 2 years. We are also focusing on AI agents, so it is in our best interest to create reliable and maintainable tooling for agents. Our interests in providing services to the ENS DAO are aligned with the DAO’s desired outcomes. This is not mercenary work for us, it is our life’s work.

* KPIs / Success Metrics
  + (we aim to have all metrics below increasing 10-20% each QTR)
  + Number of users of Copilot for ENS
  + Number of queries answered by Copilot for ENS
  + Number of integrations of ENS for AI related frameworks/tools
  + Number of npm downloads of ENS for AI packages
* Budget  
  
  $300,000 per year

## 5. Past Achievements & Additional Information

* We already have a dedicated [ENS newsfeed](https://app.x23.ai/ens), searchable [ENS discussions](https://app.x23.ai/ens/discussions), searchable [ENS proposals](https://app.x23.ai/ens/voting), and ENS specific [chat bot](https://t.me/ENSWizardBot) live and in production.
* We’ve previously received grants from ENS small grants and metagov WG for our existing work.
* We’ve received multiple grants from other DAOs including Reserve Protocol, Lido, Aave, Optimism, and Arbitrum.
* We have previously deployed a number of widely used open source [code](https://github.com/mrdavey/ez-flashloan) [examples](https://github.com/aave/flashloan-box).
* Our tools are already used by thousands of people

## 7. Conflict Of Interest Statement

We previously raised a small angel round ($250k) and Griff.eth was a small contributor.

We generate a small amount of revenue from our paying users. ![:pray:](https://discuss.ens.domains/images/emoji/twitter/pray.png?v=12 ":pray:")

We occasionally receive grants from various communities and DAOs.
