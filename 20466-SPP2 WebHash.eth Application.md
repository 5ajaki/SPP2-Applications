### 4.1 Basic Scope of Work

* Requested amount: $300,000

Problem 1: Complexity of Creating Decentralized Websites

Issue: Today, over 2 million ENS domains exist, yet shockingly 1% have decentralised websites built on them. The main reason behind this low adoption is the technical complexity involved in creating, deploying to IPFS, and connecting decentralized websites to ENS domains​.

Traditional methods demand significant technical knowledge:

* Deployment to IPFS.
* Complex integration with ENS domains.

Problem 2: Centralized Dependency on IPFS Pinning Services

Issue: Even websites considered “decentralized” heavily depend on centralized pinning services. These services pose single points of failure:

* If a centralized pinning provider changes policies, restricts access, or goes offline, dwebsites hosted through them face the risks like content loss, downtime, and censorship risks​.
* Out of the limited number of ENS domains that have successfully built decentralized websites, most remain inaccessible to users due to dependency issues with these centralized pinning services​.

WebHash: End to End infrastructure for ENS decentralised websites

WebHash isn’t just another decentralized hosting solution—it’s a comprehensive infrastructure addressing the core limitations of current decentralized web hosting. Here’s how it solves the two critical issues mentioned above:

1. Easy Creation, Deployment and Management: WebHash provides multiple tools for users of all skill levels:

* **WebHash Pro (Developer Tools)**: WebHash Pro is an advanced, developer-focused web application that enables seamless deployment of static websites, React frontends, and Next.js applications directly to the decentralized web and effortlessly connects them to ENS domains. With WebHash Pro, ENS users can now easily run decentralized applications directly on their ENS domains.

      * Simplifies deployment processes tailored specifically for each project type.
    - IPFS Deployment: Enables decentralized hosting of applications and websites on IPFS via WebHash Protocol.
    - ENS Domain Connectivity:
      * Allows users to connect their deployed IPFS-hosted websites and applications directly to Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains.
      * Simplifies the linking process, providing seamless integration and enhancing decentralized identity.
    - Custom Build Commands: Facilitates the specification of custom build commands and output directories, streamlining deployment.
    - Deployment History:
      * Comprehensive logs and easy tracking of previous deployments.
      * Quick access to previously deployed versions and their IPFS gateway URLs.
    - Environment Variables Management:
      * Secure storage and handling of sensitive information using encrypted environment variables.
      * Easily configurable and manageable via the application’s intuitive interface.
    - Seamless integration with existing developer workflows (CLI, APIs, and SDKs).

Why WebHash Matters:

By providing simplified creation and deployment tools with truly decentralized hosting, WebHash fulfills the original promise of decentralization, ensuring:

* Censorship-resistance and true decentralisation for ENS websites.
* Accessible decentralization, enabling anyone from developers to non-technical users to participate easily and confidently in the decentralized web.

WebHash effectively removes the complexity and centralized dependency barriers, finally realizing the vision of a truly decentralized web.

KPIs / Success Metrics:

* Growth of Decentralized Websites and Applications: Achieve a quarterly growth of at least 5% in the number of decentralized websites and applications created and deployed to the decentralized web.
* Expansion of WebHash Perma Nodes: Deploy and onboard at least 50 new WebHash Perma Nodes per quarter, thereby significantly increasing available storage, memory, and computational resources within the network.
* Geographic Decentralization: Ensure WebHash nodes are geographically distributed across at least 3 continents within the first quarter, and expand further to 4 continents by the fourth quarter to enhance redundancy and global resilience.
* Infrastructure Reliability: Maintain a consistent, network-wide uptime of at least 99% per quarter, ensuring high availability and reliability of decentralized hosting.
* On-Chain Transparency and Consistency: Maintain 99% accuracy and consistency in on-chain content tracking for all CID storage events and node registrations, ensuring verifiable transparency and trust across the WebHash decentralized hosting network.

### Note on KPI Evolution: These KPIs are expected to evolve as the network matures and adoption increases. Early KPIs (such as node onboarding and initial platform growth) will transition toward more advanced metrics, including node performance optimization and advanced AI moderation efficacy as the project progresses.

These quarterly KPIs provide clear, measurable targets aligned with WebHash’s goal of simplifying decentralized website hosting and eliminating centralized pinnig dependencies.

### Additional Commitment:

Alongside building the end to end infrastructure for ENS decentralised websites and applications, WebHash will continue to actively maintain and enhance its existing ecosystem products. This includes:

* eth.cd: A robust platform connecting ENS profiles with aggregated on-chain reputation, transactions, and decentralized social interactions. Ongoing updates will enhance user experience, expand integration with more Web3 protocols, and ensure seamless, decentralized communication and collaboration.
* modly.ai: An advanced LLM based content moderation service, ensuring all hosted content remains safe and compliant. Continuous refinement and integration of new detection categories will enhance moderation accuracy and response time.
* Hash Dweb Gateway: Chrome extension designed to be your portal to the decentralised web (dWeb). It enables effortless resolution of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) .eth domains, providing users with seamless access to decentralised content.

#### Budget:

The requested amount of $300,000 will be used to support development, infrastructure, marketing, and operational costs.

#### ETH.CD:

eth.cd transforms how we interact with ENS (.eth) domains by creating real-time, living profiles for every .eth name. it’s a gateway to explore, connect, and engage with ENS users. With eth.cd, we’re creating the foundation for real-time, decentralized interaction. Whether it’s supporting your favorite creators through tipping or messaging them, eth.cd positions itself as a key part of how decentralised identities are interacted with in the future. This is made possible by integration of protocols like EFP, XMTP and Huddle01, which bring decentralized communication directly into the platform.

1. Product URL: <https://eth.cd/>
2. Github URL: [eth.cd · GitHub](https://github.com/ethdotcd)
3. The utility of eth.cd is massive, with the power to capture and centralize a significant portion of the Web3 identity market:

2M+ ENS profiles all in one place, providing unmatched visibility into the ENS ecosystem.

1M+ wallet holders can use eth.cd to transact, tip, communicate, and engage with other ENS users, fueling a vibrant economy of decentralized social interaction.
